I am a Physician and Informatician that is living the dream 
in New York City. I love everything data and moreso if it is 
clinical data. Hope you enjoy poking around my portfolio - 
some interactive projects such as the 
[The HemOnc Ontology](#the-hemonc-ontology) and 
[Cancer Drug Classifications](#cancer-drug-classifications) 
are particularly fun to click around. 

Feel free to contact me with any questions. 


## Projects  

### The HemOnc Ontology {#the-hemonc-ontology}  
https://meerapatelmd.github.io/projects/hemonc_ontology/    
HemOnc is an oncology drug ontology developed by Vanderbilt 
University. The nodes and edges in this ontology closely 
resemble the way both cancer-related and non-cancer-related 
treatments are applied in clinical practice. This project 
provides a brief introduction and visualization of the 
taxonomy portion of the ontology.  
  
### Cancer Drug Classifications {#cancer-drug-classifications}   
https://meerapatelmd.github.io/projects/cancer_drug_classifications/   
Due to their inherent multifaceted nature, drugs can be classified in a
multitude of ways for a given use case. For example, a pharmacist and a
pharmacologist would likely create very different ontologies of the drug domain
due to their differing vantage points. In the Oncology Drug domain specifically,
there is yet to be a classification system reflective of the drug
categorizations following ASCO treatment guidelines and that of other oncology
consortia. Having such a classification would enable the interoperability of
cancer treatment data between institutions for situations such as transfer of
care and automated identification of specific treatment lines and treatment
history to optimize assessments for clinical trial eligibility.

### Clinical Data Quality Foundation {#clinical-data-quality-foundation}  
https://meerapatelmd.github.io/clinicalDataQuality/  
A report on the foundational clinical data quality principles 
from which more complex data quality checks can be built.  

## Presentations  
### A Novel Weighted Psychosocial Assessment Scoring System for Kidney Transplant Evaluation  
<https://meerapatelmd.github.io/projects/qualitative_kidney_transplant_study/poster.pdf>  
Qualification for the organ transplant list requires clearance from a social
workers that assesses that patient's social determinants of health and other
qualitative factors for transplant suitability. With concerns that the process
was fraught with unintentional and intentional bias, a social work fellow and I
conducted a study that created a scoring system for social workers to use to
introduce objectivity to the assessment process.
